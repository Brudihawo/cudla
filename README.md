Linear algebra library in c++, but with support for performing operations on the gpu


# Roadmap
- [ ] implement dense solving algorithms (port from c)
- [ ] factor out solving into solver classes
- [ ] implement sparse matrices (port from c)
- [ ] implement GPU multiplication
- [ ] implement GPU solving
